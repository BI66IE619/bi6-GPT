You can easily switch between API providers.

2.  Locate the `API_PROVIDER` variable at the top of the file.
3.  Change the value to either `"openrouter"` or `"deepseek"`.

    ```python
    # HacxGPT.py

    # Change this value to "deepseek" or "openrouter"
    API_PROVIDER = "openrouter" 
    ```
4. Save the file. The script will now use the selected provider's API.
